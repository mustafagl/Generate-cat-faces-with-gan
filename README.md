# Cat Face Generation with GAN

This project uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to generate realistic cat faces. The notebook demonstrates the process of creating a GAN model, training it on a dataset of cat images, and generating new cat faces.

## Project Structure

- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project.
- `cat_face_gan.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the GAN model.

## Dependencies

- Keras
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Ensure that all dependencies are installed.
2. Open the `cat_face_gan.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or any compatible IDE.
3. Run all the cells in the notebook to train the model and generate cat faces.
